# data-analytics-projects

team projects in data science course, where analysis was based on anonymous banking and retail data.

Code in this repo are my contributions to the projects. Technical skills include: Sklearn (scikit-learn), random forest, PCA, feature engineering, RNN, churn model.

Original code was written in python files, which were re-documented in Jupyter Notebooks in Colab.
